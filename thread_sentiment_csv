I’m sorry I really hate that every update they keep reducing the Liquid Glass. I did not have an issue with readability on the first beta and I thought it looked great… now a lot of things look the same as they were before iOS 26. Maybe there should be a slider for how clear the glass is?,56,2025-07-08 01:17:46

"I can see a slight frost to the Liquid Glass aesthetic, but my experience is it hasn’t been as drastic of a change as the comments lead me to believe it would be. The Liquid Glass aesthetic is still very obvious from what I am seeing. I let my phone update overnight and when I first looked at the device this morning, I wasn’t sure if it had even updated. That being said, the frost is a little more obvious in notifications, but it still has the Liquid Glass look. As I type this out, I think the major complaint is it no longer looks like liquid or glass, so I’m seeing the point you all are making now.   One super obvious change to me is the speed. My phone is much zippier and faster now. More akin to how iOS should be.",11,2025-07-08 11:59:40

Shortcuts is smoother, but scrolling up an Automation too quickly still closes it.   Really positive update though!

"Switching to dark mode brings back a lot of the glass look, which kind of proves that it wasn’t the transparency that was the issue, it was the contrast. If they could just find a good middle ground where the contrast in light mode is as high as it is in dark mode while still being relatively transparent, then it’d be fine.

The older lockscreens I customised show up but render with random transparency settings for the clock. This includes the settings for the clock height-stretch  3. I think this was an old issue, not fixed yet, Read all in messages absolutely does not work, just sets to read on some random messages and not all of them which is a PAIN  4.

This will only resolve with a restart. 3) When playing music or any audio source in fact when using any Beats Headphones the playback stutters and will not play. It works fine with Apple AirPods Pro and Max however.  4) Cannot connect to a public or corporate WiFi as pop up to enter login details disappears after a second not allowing you to enter anything.  5) Photos taken on camera don’t always show up in Photos app.",6,2025-07-13 21:42:22

Now, it’s one or the other. Thought I had this locked down (pun intended). Tried removing the widgets to no avail",9,2025-07-08 05:03:48
Still has the issue where you leave an app and the glass effect takes a moment to pop in 🙃,13,2025-07-07 17:40:55
General lag and slowdowns are mostly gone. Great update so far.,12,2025-07-07 18:20:17
Beta is working great for me! The updates keep getting better,12,2025-07-07 23:41:41
"""Don't take away Liquid Glass""   Yep, the panic is crazy and people forget that it's beta. We have until September until a release date. Trust me, it will continue to evolve. If we're at this point at iOS26.3....then the crash-out's are justified.    We will be ok, yall.",22,2025-07-07 20:06:39
"whether it’s liquid glass or frosted glass, it should be a choice left up to the user because i liked a lot of the elements from beta 1 and i wanna tweak the transparency myself.",19,2025-07-08 02:26:30
Man there is way too much whining on either side of the fence for a fucking beta lol but that’s just been the standard for a while now huh,19,2025-07-07 19:58:27
I really wish Apple wouldnt take away so much liquid glass,21,2025-07-07 19:59:09

Instead of forcing icons to be white or creamy white on a white background, they could apply that shadowing effect to icons on the home screen for better visibility. What do you think?",19,2025-07-07 20:09:44
So sad that because of all of those who complained liquid glass is frosting… I know we’re still in beta but bummer,15,2025-07-07 18:53:38

My 16 pro getting hot like crazy,13,2025-07-14 16:40:36

"15 pro struggling a bit? Facing some strange issues. Lags randomly, phone restarted and background was flashing in home screen/app drawer.",3,2025-07-07 18:42:51
Changing lock screen font between glass to solid does nothing.,6,2025-07-07 18:46:10
Despite the release notes claiming that sliding on the bottom to switch apps still does not work in Windowed App mode on an iPad… it works.,4,2025-07-07 18:56:06
This beta 3 is much better. No more stutters for me,3,2025-07-07 22:43:07
Last update broke sideloading for me here in the US. This beta fixed it for me,4,2025-07-08 01:32:27

The overheating calmed a bit! But I still experience animation stuttering when my icons set to clear  Edit: for some reason customizing my lock screen overheats my phone in seconds.,3,2025-07-08 15:53:59
Is mobile data working for everyone?,5,2025-07-08 15:58:23
The white borders are so ugly.. I liked beta1 more than 2 & 3 on interface,3,2025-07-08 16:05:38
Beautiful. The safari open in background bug is finally fixed,4,2025-07-08 16:37:01
Anyone else have problem that battery procentage disappeared in the control panel,5,2025-07-08 20:49:05
"Is anyone having the pictures for contacts in the Unified setting (as opposed to ""Classic"") blacked out? Most of my favorites have a black rectangle and a name, not the contact picture. I had this in DB2 and DB3 has not fixed it. iOS 26 db3",4,2025-07-08 22:19:49
The middle of the screen swiping in safari is terrible. If a website requires you to scroll side to side on something you end up just going back a page.,3,2025-07-09 17:22:51
Dark mode still being Liquid Glass because the dark glass has more contrast and visibility is my villain origin story. Really hope Apple finds a happy medium for light mode!,4,2025-07-10 01:08:23
"In terms of smoothness and lag in performance b3 is better for me (15PM) but the battery drain is a problem, b2 is better imo and also i've been having persistent bugs with messages app unlike with the bugs with b1/2 which is usually just go away with a swipe / app close / restart. With the messages app it's persistent almost everytime. It's useable just annoying for me like missed messages not showing on my phone but showing on my watch (fixed if you turn off message filtering) and wrong unread badge number (on top left by the back button) when I'm inside a conversation",4,2025-07-10 15:44:58
"Not sure if it's better on my phone (16PM) since I'm still gettting random stuttering and massive slowdowns when playing games or browsing web. However, much better carplay performance than previous versions and overheating is minimal now. Battery drain hasn't changed.",4,2025-07-10 18:21:26
This whole auto mix thing for Apple. It’s a great concept if they could get it to work. Half the time doesn’t mix on measure. And if you cannot have anything else mixable unless just what they give you. Not no uploaded content. It’s kind of useless for some people.,4,2025-07-15 05:08:46

Really disappointed they toned down the liquid glass this much. Feel like there could have been solutions for most of the issues. Would love if they even introduced a slider to customize how much you want the glass to be frosted.,21,2025-07-07 19:51:38
Is anyone else annoyed that dark mode app icons aren’t really dark? It’s like a dark grey instead of pure black.,6,2025-07-07 22:05:51
I had the iOS 26 beta 2 on for its full duration but this one is much faster. Seems to be getting way closer to an actual release this is great.,7,2025-07-08 00:07:18
Control center randomly won’t display my battery status.,6,2025-07-08 00:22:12
I had to charge my phone multiple times a day running beta 2…beta 3 seems a bit more stable but I need to do further testing. So far so good!,6,2025-07-08 13:18:22
Battery genuinely vastly improved. iPhone 14PM at 83% battery health.,6,2025-07-09 00:18:05
"Should use Give Feedback to bring back liquid glass, and just make ""Reduce Transparency"" a setup action like ""Display Size"" or ""Light or Dark"" is when you're setting up your device. Just make it an option on first boot, that way people know it's there.  I was waiting for Public Beta, and now I won't even get any liquid glass UI effects lol",16,2025-07-07 19:16:24
it looks like that transparency on windows 11 now AND IT LOOKS ATROCIOUS.,18,2025-07-07 22:10:38
Hope keyboard freezing is fixed.,9,2025-07-07 18:27:28
Would be dope if they had a frosted or regular glass feature,9,2025-07-08 00:14:06
Battery and performance much better than DB2 was worse had worst drain on my ip16 pro max. DB3 is stable no issues so far!,12,2025-07-07 20:47:20
"This is probably an unpopular opinion, but Apple is gradually ruining the Liquid Glass effect here and there. First they ruined it in Control Center. Now they ruin it in Safari and in a few other places (like in Music I think). They spent tons of time and effort (and probably lots of money) to study how things look in real life under glass as demonstrated in some parts of the WWDC video with all those specially-created custom-made pieces of glass. It seems now they're in the process of removing those beautiful Liquid Glass elements here and there and are replacing them with just boring frosted transparent ""materials"" that I feel doesn't deserve the name ""Liquid Glass"".  I miss the beauty of the Liquid Glass in DB1.",36,2025-07-07 20:06:29
If its true they are reducing the effect i hope the full intended effect remains an option somewhere,10,2025-07-07 18:56:02
This update is heavenly so far imo. My keyboard is better than it has been throughout the entirety of iOS 18... I really hope we're gonna finally have some stability with this little stuff 🤞🏼,10,2025-07-08 02:58:21
Can finally clear all notifications from lock screen when full screen cover art is being displayed! Thank fucking god.,7,2025-07-07 18:34:49
"3rd Developer Beta and the issue with non-Apple batteries not being able to charge still persists (Reports as 1% charged with 0% battery health). Let's hope it's fixed before Public Beta?  (Before anyone leaves a comment about *blah blah blah why are you on a developer beta*, this is for a secondary device (13 Mini) and I have reported the issue via feedback.)",4,2025-07-07 19:05:15

"Terribly slow animations and other slowdowns lately.   Safari takes forever to load.   Hopefully Apple can look into these, already submitted.",5,2025-07-16 14:13:05
Damn. No clear dark icons with color,7,2025-07-07 17:48:48
Personally I think it should be up to the user to adjust transparency and glass,9,2025-07-12 01:28:12
"It’s still early in beta so I guess they can ultimately tone back the liquid glass to fix it. We’re still 2ish months away from an official release so I’m not super worried, but it is a bit of a bummer",10,2025-07-07 18:07:45
What's with all the posts about the download size? What does it matter? Someone isn't going to bother not installing if the size is too big? Can these posts also be banned? It is providing absolutely nothing of value to the discussion of what is changing as part of the beta.,31,2025-07-07 17:46:12
"iPhone 15 Pro Max  coming from beta 2, the update def fix a lot of problems for me such as the Apple Maps bug where it would just go berzerk when searching for any destination as well as camera bugs through messages app  and that annoying bug with the dock where it wouldn't center the icons. animations are much smoother and it was def a tad slow which is expected when updating to beta 3.",3,2025-07-07 21:48:05
AutoMix seems to be more effective in Apple Music,3,2025-07-07 22:01:44

It’s reconnecting to the usb-c hub every 2 seconds as soon as I plug in hdmi into the hub. when i do this, I’ll also loose connection to plugged in usb drives and to power delivery.

I'm not getting all text messages on my phone. I found out because i have an apple watch (not on beta) and i recieved a message on my watch and when i opened my phone to view the message it wasn't there. I restarted my phone and everything but still isn't showing. My watch still shows the message,3,2025-07-08 22:56:59
Anyone see order status in the Wallet widget.  I have lots of orders that wallet is pulling from my emails but the widget is blank.  I have submitted this in feedback app but it says I’m the only one who reported the issue,3,2025-07-09 01:55:53
Contact search in the contacts app is gone,3,2025-07-09 02:42:26
I’m not sure if it’s just me but does anyone else dislike how they slightly changed the App Switcher? I think I need to reach a bit farther left now to switch to my previous app and it’s irking me everytime I have to do it,3,2025-07-09 04:42:03
"bizarre change on the 16 pro beta. If an animation becomes slow, closing or opening apps, entire OS and animations is unbearably slow. Rebooting the iPhone resolves it.",3,2025-07-09 13:17:44

"Keyboard freeze seems to be solved and, for me, that enough would be worth the upgrade over previous betas. Overall the device runs decently, both in battery backup and in performance (no warming or whatever). 11 Pro.",3,2025-07-10 04:35:01
"Battery drain is indeed worse now but an interesting thing I discovered is that the menu for scrolling through lock-screens has NEVER been this smooth. It would always lag in some way or another even on stable versions of iOS 18 but now it's extremely fluid, I don't know what they did to it.",3,2025-07-10 13:03:47
Is it okay to install right now on a base 15? Had to downgrade before because of the lag in beta 1,3,2025-07-11 05:24:28

Anyone else having issues with their signal? My 15 PM is just dropping signal randomly and I have to restart it to get it back.,3,2025-07-13 12:33:30
So far I've been pretty impressed with the developer beta for iOS 26. I noticed right off the bat i didn't get the typical piping hot battery drainer I'm used to..,3,2025-07-16 00:29:31

This is db3. I went to school for graphic design and in no way would this be okay in any context. The user should not need to enable reduce transparency to be able to see the main functions of the app they’re in. The shift toward a more frosted glass design is the right choice because by every accessibility readability usability test this is NOT GOOD. And before you reply, YES I know it’s a beta and YES I reported it. But this is a forum for talking about the beta so I am talking about it.",36,2025-07-07 20:45:58
we went from f to g,9,2025-07-07 17:45:48
I hate how they are reverting everything. So disappointing,19,2025-07-07 19:51:01
Honestly the lack of liquid glass is making me stay away from this update for good. It was so good,11,2025-07-07 22:43:20
1 hour with the beta so far and my phone can cook an egg on it.,7,2025-07-07 18:26:27

I noticed heating isn’t as bad but has anyone else’s phone been more laggy than before? This beta doesn’t feel any better than beta 2. Beta 1 to 2 was a decent difference with lag and stutter but this beta feel as bad or worse than beta 2 lag and stutter wise. And also a bug I found is in messages if you’re in a thread with a person and look at the back button it shows 5 unread messages even though there isn’t.,5,2025-07-08 08:13:13

So annoying they nerfed the Liquid Glass affect. People would have eventually got used to it.  Hopefully they restore to previous beta levels or at least offer some sort of toggle in accessibility for people who absolutely hate it.,15,2025-07-08 10:35:14
I really think you guys are not understanding the beta process. This is most likely temporary like very high chance it’ll be back by next beta. If there were issues with resources or algorithms when it came to the liquid glass they may have temporarily dialed it back while they work on it.,8,2025-07-07 19:54:29

"Minor performance hiccups upon first boot which is expected, but after it’s done indexing I noticed it’s waaaay snappier! Scrolling feels almost close to iOS 18 in terms of smoothness. Keyboard feels so much quicker, it doesn’t stutter much (apart from Safari. The keyboard still stutters when a page is loading on Safari upon app launch)",8,2025-07-07 17:48:53
Liquid glass has been toned down so much that I’d rather it just be Gaussian blur like old iOS. Who knew that focusing a UI around a transparent material would affect legibility? (The amount of stuff they had to do to the glass to make it legiblekinda tells me it was a mistake.) More shadows and depth would have looked so much better.,9,2025-07-07 19:03:53
Wow glass was removed what a waste of time looks like they’ll change it again though after backlash for the 3rd time lmao bring glass back!! Wasn’t that the whole point of the update?!? Fn stupid,9,2025-07-07 22:45:17

"I think they really need to rethink about the design philosophy for Liquid Glass. It’s obvious that they haven’t quite polished it yet and now things are very frosted, which I like because it makes things easier to read. However there are other elements that didn’t need to be frosted because there wasn’t text. The refractions on the old glass was super cool and revolutionary, I hate to see less of it. I think it’s kinda early but I feel like this is a step in the right direction at least. I would expect a couple more changes to take place in future updates.",10,2025-07-07 19:56:22

A characteristic of general conversation about betas is that anytime someone complains about a beta someone else yells it’s just a beta. The whole point of a beta is to make changes and gather feedback. This isn’t really a response to your comment. I am just reflecting on the fact that it isn’t that bad in this subreddit and people get there will be bugs and that there will be opportunities to discuss changes.,4,2025-07-08 15:39:51

"Fundamentally it’s impossible to make consistently accessible, readable text without frosting. Imagine a wallpaper background that alternates between black, gray and white stripes - there’s no way you can choose a single text color for a notification that’s visible on top of all those backgrounds at once - and the text swapping colors mid-sentence would be incredibly hard to read.   This outcome feels inevitable to me - as cool as liquid glass is as a visual effect, and how well it works in certain limited use cases, as a key surface for controls on top of vibrant and uncontrolled content like webpages, wallpapers and covert art, glass just isn’t a workable solution.   In real life, we use frosting, or stickers for the same reason when working with signage on glass.",7,2025-07-08 06:29:57

Pretty cool effects and the like, however from a UX experience I *really* don't think that it was great. Readability was terrible in certain places and created a disjointed experience across the ecosystem. I wasn't the only one to feel that way, and unfortunately, I can't think of any other means of accomplishing this than to scale back the transparency.  That's where we are now and people aren't pleased. So, again, I ask everyone: What is the proper solution?

Apple would have been trying out all of the Liquid Glass changes internally and likely there were discussions and disagreements on how far to push it either way - they are probably trying these out in Betas to see folks reactions to make final decisions. But I also agree they may have changed it to measure resource utilization in the wild across the various devices.,3,2025-07-07 20:08:56

"They previously had a timeless and minimalist design that did its job unobtrusively, no matter what else was shown on the display. Paired with very low resource consumption.

So far battery use has been WAY better for me. Not as good as a retail release but good enough for a beta and it’s no longer a hand warmer.   Beta 3 fixed a TON of issues for me. It feels like the first “stable” beta. The first two betas were the worst of any beta I’ve ever run in terms of battery and just broken stuff. iOS 13 was the last one I remember being that buggy.,4,2025-07-08 18:51:15

"My opinion as a Senior UI/UX designer is that even though I LOVE the Liquid Glass effect on the new iOS, Aesthetics should never be over functionality and accessibility. Apple Design Team, as every other team is a Data-Driven team, meaning every design decision is based on huge amount of data and usability test on their users. The fact that you or I doesn’t find readability issues doesn’t mean that a large chunk of their users base actually does and they are making the absolutely right decision to tone down an aesthetic feature in benefit of a usability issue. Rest assured that if they are tweaking the effect is because they have been running Usability tests and have that the data to back up the change. Also, regarding your statement that “people will eventually get use to it”, A very very basic principle of User Centered design is exactly the opposite to that, technology should ALWAYS adapt to human needs and not otherwise.",21,2025-07-08 10:59:57

"It’s a very difficult line to navigate between “new shiny UI” and “almost completely illegible”. Honestly I’m not convinced that the eye candy is worth the visibility acquisition hit of Liquid Glass. It’s also a lot of effort placed into shinies at the expense of other issues that still need attention in iOS. The shortest path to appearing to be developing is to work on the UI layer and I like pretty things too but removing usability like Slide Over, and continuing to be inferior to Android regarding notification usefulness and interactivity, make me wish they were focusing on something else besides smoke and mirrors.",3,2025-07-07 23:47:49

"You should review the app compatibility chart (link below) to see if any of your critical apps are not working /have unexpected behavior. Once you do that - especially after people start updating for DB3 - you'll be in the best place to make a judgment call.  I jumped on iOS 26 beta train today for the first time with DB3 (iPhone 16PM) and all seems fine. There were certain widgets that took a while to render (an hour or two), but that's because the OS is reindexing files in the background (which will take several hours and will cause the phone to use more battery that normal daily usage).

I agree with you completely   People are acting like it’s been removed. The transparency was changed but the reactivity of all the elements is still there. This isn’t “basically iOS 18” it’s still way more fluid and less static. Liquid glass doesn’t need to be literally transparent glass everywhere it appears lmao,7,2025-07-07 19:04:44

"I know why they did it. All I'm saying is, I wish I could somehow be responsible for convincing everyone to stop complaining about it and to ask for the original Liquid Glass to come back. Or to at least give us the ability to tweak it as we wish.  I just don't want them to keep turning the beautiful ""clear"" Liquid Glass in to frosted versions because then the beauty of the Liquid Glass effect is much less noticeable. Then if you're just glancing at everything instead of stopping to look closely at the Liquid Glass effect, the frosted versions just look plain, as though there's no Liquid Glass effect whatsoever. The clear ones are easy to notice, even at a glance. It creates the ""oh wow"" reaction because it makes you take notice. The frosted versions almost require someone else to point it out, like ""Look closely and scroll/swipe slowly."" smh",8,2025-07-07 20:11:33

Unfortunately I’m sure the engineering team saw the backlash and stuff to beta 1 and that’s why we got the slight tone down of some of the glassy elements which I thought was ok, but this more frosted look, I’m not a fan.
